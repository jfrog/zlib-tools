# CVE-2018-25032 detector
​
A script for searching binaries that use the vulnerable deflateInit2() function of zlib, for detecting CVE-2018-25032 applicability.
The script scans a path recursively and prints binaries that use deflateInit2(), either dynamically-linked or statically-linked with symbols.
Note: Binaries that are statically-linked with zLib but without symbols are not analyzed by this script.
​
##### Usage
​
```
./CVE_2018_25032_scanner.sh PATH
```
##### Output

List of binaries found using the vulnerable deflateInit2() function of zLib.

##### Mitigations

The bug was only proven to be triggered when zlib is initialized with non-default values, in any of the following ways -
1. deflateInit2(&strm, 7, Z_DEFLATED, 15, 1, Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY); (level can be either 7, 8 or 9)
2. deflateInit2(&strm, X, Z_DEFLATED, X, X, Z_FIXED); (X denoting any possible input)

In addition to that, an attacker must control the input data that will be fed to the compressor (the input buffer to deflate())

Z_FIXED is for testing purposes only so in all cases, it should be avoided to use it for release.
Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY with MemLevel=1 should be avoided.
