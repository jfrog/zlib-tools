# CVE-2018-25032 detector
A script for searching binaries that use the vulnerable `deflateInit2()` function of zlib, for detecting CVE-2018-25032 applicability.
The script scans a path recursively and prints binaries that use `deflateInit2()`, either dynamically-linked or statically-linked with symbols.
Note: Binaries that are statically-linked with zLib but without symbols are not analyzed by this script.
##### Usage
```
./CVE_2018_25032_scanner.sh FOLDER_PATH
```
##### Output

List of binaries found using the vulnerable `deflateInit2()` function of zLib.

##### Mitigations

The bug was only proven to be triggered when zlib is initialized with non-default values, in any of the following ways -
1. `deflateInit2(&strm, 7, Z_DEFLATED, 15, 1, Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY);` (level can be either 7, 8 or 9)
2. `deflateInit2(&strm, X, Z_DEFLATED, X, X, Z_FIXED);` (X denoting any possible input)

In addition to that, an attacker must control the input data that will be fed to the compressor (the input buffer to deflate())

Do not use `Z_FIXED` as it is for testing purposes only so in all cases, it should be avoided to use it for production.
Also, do not use `Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY with MemLevel=1` as it is also is highly unlikely in production code (slows down performance)
